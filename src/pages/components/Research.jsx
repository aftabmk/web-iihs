            The IIHS Research Programme locates itself within two simultaneous global transitions. Globally, cities and regions are being recognised as being central to the agenda of transformation to an equitable, and sustainable world. International policy developments such as the adoption of Goal 11 of the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that focuses on urban settlements, mark this emergence.
